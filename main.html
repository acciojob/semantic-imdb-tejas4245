	<section id="actor">,Two college friends Archi and Parshya, who belong to different castes, fall in love with each other.
		 However, their relationship faces struggle due to the stringent practice of casteism.Sairat 
		(transl. Wild) is a 2016 Indian Marathi-language romantic tragedy film directed by Nagraj Manjule and produced by Manjule himself under his banner Aatpat Production 
		along with Nittin Keni and Nikhil Sane under Essel Vision Productions and Zee Studios. Starring Rinku Rajguru and Akash Thosar in their debuts, 
		it tells the story of two young college students from different castes who fall in love, sparking conflict between their families.

Manjule conceived the story in 2009, basing it on his experiences of caste discrimination, 
		but scrapped it when he decided that it was boring. After making Fandry (2013), he revisited the story and completed its script the following year. 
		The screenplay was written by Manjule, and his brother Bharat penned the dialogues. The film was shot in Manjule's village, Jeur in Karmala Taluka of Solapur district in Maharashtra. 
		Sudhakar Reddy Yakkanti was the director of photography, and Kutub Inamdar edited the film.</section>
